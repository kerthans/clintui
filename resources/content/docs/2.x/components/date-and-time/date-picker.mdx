## Basic

A date picker combines a DateField with a Calendar popover, allowing users to either type in or select a date and time.

## Date and Time
While not a full-fledged date-time picker, this setup lets you edit both date and time in a segmented field.

## Validation
To ensure that the date picker is filled out, use the `isRequired` prop.

## Custom Validation
The `validate` function is your go-to for custom validation rules. It checks the current date value and returns an error message string or strings if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

## Controlled
Take control of your date picker by passing a `value` prop, which allows you to manage the selected date.

## Disabled
When the date picker is disabled, it becomes non-interactive and visually represents a disabled state.
