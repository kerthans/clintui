## Using Intent CLI
Just run init command to start a new project:
<Installation command='npx @intentui/cli@latest init' />
With that command, Intent will ask you a few questions about your project.
```
✔ No setup project detected. Do you want to start a new project? (Y/n) Yes
✔ What language do you want to use? Typescript
? Which framework do you want to use?
❯ Laravel
  Next.js
  Remix
  Vite
```

## Laravel Installer
If you prefer the Laravel Installer, you can set up Intent by running the following command:
<Installation command='laravel new app --using=intentui/laravel'/>

## Composer
Alternatively, if you're using Composer, install Intent with the command below:
<Installation command='composer create-project intentui/laravel app'/>

Once installed, you can start adding components to your project by running:
<Installation command='npx @intentui/cli@latest add table'/>

## Source Code
You can also clone the repository to get started right away. Clone the latest version from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/intentuilabs/laravel).
