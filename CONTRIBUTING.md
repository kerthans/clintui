## Folder Structure

The folder structure is as follows:
### Components
The components folder is the core of this project, it contains `ui`, `docs` and `blocks` folders.
```
components
├── blocks
├── code
├── docs
│   ├── anatomies
│   ├── buttons ...
│   ├── charts ...
│   ├── collections ...
│   ├── colors ...
│   ├── controls ...
│   ├── date-and-time ...
│   ├── drag-and-drop ...

│   ├── navigation ...
│   ├── outside ...
│   ├── overlays ...
│   ├── pickers ...
│   ├── statuses ...
│   └── surfaces ...
├── experimental
└── ui
```
The core ui is inside `components/ui`, and the demo you see on the docs is inside `components/docs`.

### Registry
The registry is a file that contains all the components and their files. It is used to generate the `demo`, `ui`, `blocks` and `anatomies` on the docs.
```
public/registry
├── anatomies
├── blocks
│   ├── navbar ...
│   └── sidebar ...
├── demo
│   ├── buttons ...
│   ├── charts ...
│   ├── collections ...

│   ├── outside
│   ├── overlays ...
│   ├── pickers ...
│   ├── statuses ...
│   └── surfaces ...
├── docs

```

All of this is generated by the `resources/scripts/build-registry.ts` script by running `bun run b`.
