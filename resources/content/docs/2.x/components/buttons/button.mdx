## Size
Buttons are available in multiple sizes.

## With Icon
You can add icons to buttons, and their color will match the button's color.

<How toUse="buttons/button/button-icon-demo" />

## With Only Icon
For icon-only buttons, use the `size="square-petite"` prop to make them more compact.

## Disabled
A disabled button cannot be interacted with and is visually styled to reflect its state.

## Pending
A button can indicate a pending state using the `isPending` prop. This provides feedback for actions that take time, communicates the status to assistive technologies, and disables interactions except for focus.

## With Loader
You can add a loader to indicate ongoing processes.

## Link
Sometimes, you need to use styles from buttons for links. Just use the link and use the `buttonStyles` to the className prop.
