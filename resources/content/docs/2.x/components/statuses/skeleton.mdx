## Basic

Skeleton is a placeholder component that displays a loading state while your content loads. It's a great way to keep your layout looking fresh and prevent users from getting stuck on a blank page.

## Shape
Sometimes, you may need a skeleton with a specific shape. For example, if you want all skeletons to be circular, you can simply add `rounded-full` to the skeleton component. This example demonstrates how to achieve that by styling the skeleton from its parent.
