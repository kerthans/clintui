## What's New
- Upgrade to Tailwind v4.
- With Tailwind v4 adopting OKLCH for colors, we've aligned our format to match.
- Remove TRAC
- Redesign every component
- Remove color `accent-subtle`, `accent-subtle-fg`, `tertiary`, `tertiary-fg`
- Add color `sidebar`, `sidebar-fg`, `navbar`, `navbar-fg`.
- Add color for charts `chart-1`, `chart-2`, `chart-3`, `chart-4`, `chart-5`
- Calendar and Range Calendar now by default use `rounded-lg` instead of `rounded-full`
- Some existing components, such as [Chart](/docs/components/charts/setup), [Sidebar](/docs/components/layouts/sidebar), [Disclosure](/docs/components/navigation/disclosure), and [TagGroup](/docs/components/collections/tag-group), no longer utilize the [Compound Pattern](https://www.patterns.dev/react/compound-pattern/).
- Add new page [Blocks](/blocks)
- Grid move to Alpha
- Grid remove Collections
- `cn()` now is moved to `utils/classes.ts` to more consistent with the rest of the components.
- `useMediaQuery` now is move to `utils/use-media-query.ts`
- Pagination now use `segment` props instead of `variant`.
- Allow `visibleDuration` to [Date Range Picker](/date-range-picker) and [Range Calendar](/range-calendar)
- Some components rewrite to be better including:
  - Sidebar
  - Disclosure
  - Navbar
  - Button
  - Field



## Pages
Several pages have been updated, and there's also a new one.

### Blocks
The new **Blocks** page showcases complex components like sidebars and navbars. If you're interested, you can check it out [here](/blocks).
<BlockSandbox
    {...{
        isIframe: true,
        title: "Default Sidebar",
        defaultSelected: "app-sidebar.tsx",
        fullscreen: "/blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01",
        preview: "/blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01",
        expandKeys: ["components", "app"],
        initialRegistry: "blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01/app-sidebar",
        folders: {
            components: {
                ui: {
                    "badge.tsx": "ui/badge",
                    "separator.tsx": "ui/separator",
                    "sheet.tsx": "ui/sheet",
                    "tooltip.tsx": "ui/tooltip",
                    "primitive.tsx": "ui/primitive",
                    "button.tsx": "ui/button",
                    "sidebar.tsx": "ui/sidebar",
                },
            "app-sidebar.tsx": "blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01/app-sidebar",
        },
        app: {
            "page.tsx": "blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01/page",
            "layout.tsx": "blocks/sidebar/sidebar-01/layout",
            "global.css": "docs/installation/main.css",
        },
    },
    }}
/>

### Themes
The **Themes** page has been improved. It's no longer just a list of themes; instead, it allows you to customize your theme, including options for primary colors, accents, base grays, and default border radius. Explore it [here](/themes).
<GeneratedTheme className='max-h-96'/>

### Colors
With Tailwind v4 adopting OKLCH for colors, we've updated our format to align with it. Discover the new colors [here](/colors).

## CLI
The CLI has been updated to support projects using Tailwind v3. It intelligently detects your project type and installs the necessary packages.
