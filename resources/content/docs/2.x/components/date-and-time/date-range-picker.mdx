## Installation
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true }} items={['date-range-picker']}/>

## Composed Components
<Composed components={['date-picker', 'date-field', 'field']}/>

## Validation
Ensure that the date range picker is properly filled out by using the `isRequired` prop.

## Custom Validation
Use the `validate` function to implement custom validation rules. It evaluates the current date range and returns error messages if the value doesn't meet your criteria.

## Visible Duration
You can control the duration of the visible date range by using the `visibleDuration` prop. It accepts an object with the following properties:
* `years`: The number of years to add or subtract.
* `months`: The number of months to add or subtract.
* `weeks`: The number of weeks to add or subtract.
* `days`: The number of days to add or subtract.
