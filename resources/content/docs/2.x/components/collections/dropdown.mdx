## Basic
Thereâ€™s not much to see here directly, but you can check out related components like [Menu](/docs/components/collections/menu), [Combo Box](/docs/components/pickers/combo-box), and others.

<Note>
  Heads up: when you incorporate components such as **menu**, **select**, or **combo-box**, the dropdown functionality is included automatically. No separate installation required.
