# Code of Conduct

The Intent code of conduct is inspired by the Laravel and Ruby code of conduct. Any violations of this code may be reported to Irsyad (irsyad@parsinta.com):

- Participants will respect and be tolerant of differing views and opinions.
- Participants must ensure that their language and actions remain professional and free of personal attacks or disparaging remarks.
- When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
- Behavior that can reasonably be considered harassment or discrimination will not be tolerated.
