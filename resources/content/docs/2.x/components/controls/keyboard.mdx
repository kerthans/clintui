## Basic
There’s not much to showcase here, but you can explore related components such as the [Menu](/docs/components/collections/menu) and [CommandMenu](/docs/components/controls/command-menu).

<Note>
  Just a heads up: incorporating components like **menu** or **command menu** automatically integrates the keyboard component as well. There’s no need to install it separately.
