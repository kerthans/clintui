## Colors
The Intent color system is crafted to ensure a consistent and accessible color palette throughout your application. It features a diverse range of colors, including primary, secondary, accent, and muted shades.

This is the default theme in Intent. You can personalize it by customizing settings on the [themes](/themes) page.
<GeneratedTheme className='max-h-120 not-prose' />

## Change Gray
When you install Intent using the CLI, you'll be prompted to select your preferred gray scale. Options include Tailwind's default grays such as `gray`, `slate`, `zinc`, `stone`, and `neutral`. If needed, you can always visit the [themes](/themes) page to change your selection.
Or by running the following command:
<Installation options={{isExecutor: true}} command='npx @intentui/cli@latest change-gray' items={['']} />

Learn more about the CLI in the [CLI](/cli) documentation.
