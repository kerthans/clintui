Now, open your `vite.config.ts` file and add the following to the `plugins` array:
```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tailwindcss(),
    react()
  ],
})
