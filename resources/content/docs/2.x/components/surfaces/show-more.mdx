## Basic
The `ShowMore` component is primarily used to encapsulate content that can be expanded or collapsed. It renders the content as initially hidden, and it expands to show more when interacted with by the user.

## Installation
<Installation options={{ isComponent: true }} items={['show-more']}/>

## Manual Installation
<Installation options={{ isManual: true }} items={['react-aria-components']}/>
<SourceCode toShow='show-more'/>

## Anatomy
Import the components and use them as shown below, adapting the structure to fit each component.
```
import { IconChevronLgDown } from "@intentui/icons"
import { ShowMore } from "@/components/ui/show-more"
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge"

<ShowMore>
  {({ isSelected }) => (
    <>
      Show {isSelected ? "less" : "more"}
      <IconChevronLgDown
        className={twMerge(
          isSelected ? "rotate-180" : "",
          "size-4 transition-transform duration-200"
        )}
      />
    </>
  )}
</ShowMore>
```

## As Text
While the default behavior utilizes a button for interactions, the `ShowMore` component can also be configured to function as a clickable text element.

## Controlled
Gain fine-grained control over the `ShowMore` component's behavior. This setup ensures you can manage the expanded state externally, ideal for more complex interactions.

## Orientation
The default orientation for the `ShowMore` component is horizontal. However, it can easily be adjusted to a vertical layout to suit different design needs.
