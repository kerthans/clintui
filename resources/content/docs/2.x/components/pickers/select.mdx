## Label
When the `children` option is a string, `Select.Label` will automatically wrap it. However, if the option includes an icon or avatar, you'll need to manually define the wrapper like this:

```
<Select.Option id="discord" textValue="Discord">
  <IconBrandDiscord />
  <Select.Label>Discord</Select.Label>
</Select.Option>
```

## Disabled
When the select component is disabled, it cannot be interacted with.
