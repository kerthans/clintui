## Sticky
You can use the `Sheet.Body` component to make the sheet sticky.

## Header
This setupâ€™s super flexible. If you skip adding `Sheet.Title` and just drop a string as its child, it'll auto-render as the title. Like this:
```
<Sheet.Header>
  Title
</Sheet.Header>
```
Wanna customize more? Throw in props like `title` and `description` for a tailored header:
```
<Sheet.Header title='Title' description='Description' />
```

## Custom Styles
